The main goal of this project is to improve my HTML and CSS skills by practicing fundamentals such as:

- CSS box model, flexbox, and layout techniques  
- Responsive design basics  

I used this project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) to challenge myself and enhance my coding abilities.
